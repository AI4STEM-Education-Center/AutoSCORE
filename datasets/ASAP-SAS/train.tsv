2788	2	1	1	Changing the type of grafin would improve the student's experiment give a better new at those data. ^P Give the names of each type of plastic type used in this experiment. Each plastic should be the same length. ^P My conclusion is plastic type held up a much stronger than all of the different types.
2789	2	3	3	Concluding from the students data that plastic type B was the stretchiest, while type A is the least stretchy. Two ways that the students could have improved their experiment is to have described how much height to use. Another way that they could have gotten more valid results is clarify how much plastic to use, hanging of the table.
2790	2	1	1	Two ways that the stundent could've improved the experiment is by getting a more better brand of plastic or simply redo the experiment.
2791	2	1	1	A conclusion I can make from this experiment is that plastic type B is the stretchable because in trial one it stretched 22mm,while in trial two it stretched 23mm without breaking. One way the student can improve the design is by adding more weights. A second way is to include more trials so there is more to compare to.
2792	2	3	3	a.One conclusion I can draw is that plastic B stretched the most than there was plastic D, the next plastic C and finally plastic A. b. They could have used more trials. Two trials is not enough to have a valid experiment. Next they could have said how long each plastic had to be. If there is more or less on one plastic then there could be more polymers making the experiment invalid.
2793	2	2	3	My conclusion to this experiment is that plastic sample B streched the most because it was probly a sample streches easily.^p B) Two things that could be changed is saying what kind of plastic it was and saying hope much weight is put on each clamp.
2794	2	1	1	You can conclude that plastic B was the most maluble and was able to stretch the most while plastic A was the most rigid and least stretchable. Two ways the experiment could have improved was to also test for longer amounts of time, to see if time was a factor. Using different wights for different trials could also give out more beneficial data.
2795	2	2	1	By looking at the results, one can see that plastic type B and D stretched almost twice as much as the other two types. This shows us that B and D are most likely low density polymers because of their flexibility. A and C however are not as flexible and therefore are high density polymers. The experiment could have been improved by adding another plastic type or running more trials. The weights could have been changed also to test the strength.
2796	2	2	2	Material type A stretched the least, and material type B stretched the most. Material type B stretched about 12 mm more than A. A few ways the student could have the experiment is be could have gotten different length plastic to test it different ways. Also he could have added more trials and averaged them together to get more accurate results.
2797	2	3	3	a) A conclusion about this data is that plastic type A+B stretched longer the second trial and that type C stretched longer the first and D stayed the same. You can also conclude that plastic B has greatest stretchability. B) Two ways [the students could have improved the experimental are sign is that they could have done more trials to increase validity. They also could have used the same length of different plastics each time.
2798	2	3	3	a. Plastic type B is proven to be the most strehable material because it has stricthed to the greatest length which was 22mm and 23 mm. b. 2 ways to improve the experiment is there should be 2 trials and the size of each material before being stretched should be held constant.
2799	2	1	2	A) Based on the student's data, I can draw the conclusion that plastic type A is the most duriable because it stretched the least (an average of 11mm), while plastic type D is the least duriable. ^P B) To improve this experiment, the student's could have added a control and specified how much weight should be added to the clamp.
2800	2	3	2	Based on the student's data, plastic B stretched more. b The students could have improved the experiment by resting the plastics at the same length  also by doing more than just two trials using sam. Putting same amount of weight in the type of plastic bag.
2801	2	3	3	a) The students concluded that platic B was the most flexible, stretching up to 23mm on the second trial and 22mm on the first. b) The student could have improved this design and validity of his lab in two ways. First he could have done the experiment a third time to further confirm results. Second, the student could have been more descriptive in his procedure explaing how to add weight to the clamp and how much weight to actually add.
2802	2	1	2	Based on the students data, it looks like all 4 types of plastic stretched at least 10mm. The most amount stretched was 22mm for plastic type B then 20mm for D, 14 mm for c and 10mm for A. ^p To make the experiment more valid the student could perform more trials maybe using a different type of clamp or other weights to  test the plastic's flexibility.
2803	2	3	3	A conclusion that can be drawn from the students data is that plastic B has the most stretchability. Two ways this student could have imposed the experimental design and or validity of the results is. The students could have said what the initial length of the plastic was and keep all the others plastics at the same length because if one plastic was longer than the other the experiment would be valid. And they also say how much the weights that were being used weighed because one could be heavier than the other.
2804	2	2	2	A conclusion that can be made based on this experiment is plastic type D stretches the most, plastic type D stretches the second most, plastic C the third most and plastic A the least most. The students could have improved the validity of the experiment by including another trials. Also including what size or how heavy of a weight to use for in the experiment.
2805	2	0	0	A. Based on this student's data, I conclude that trial 2 was more effective.^p B. One way the student could have improved the experimental design is give the names of the plastics they used.
2806	2	1	1	a) In conclusion, plastic type A is the strongest plastic and plastic type D is the weakest plastic because it streched the most. ^P B) the student should have made sure all the plastic lengths were equal. The experimenter should have also tested them all at the same time to get accurate data.
2807	2	3	3	As shown in the data table, I can conclude that plastic type B was able to stretch the most in the 5 minutes.  The table also shows that plastic type A stretched the least, concluding it was very strong or had less polymers. Two ways the students can improve their experimental design would be to make sure that all the plastic samples were the same length. Another way the students can improve the experiment would be to include the weights so an independent variable can be clearly stated/seen.
2808	2	1	1	a. Based on the students data I can conclude that T2 overall had better results that T1, for T1, A, B and C were all longer than T1. ^p 3b. The student could have improved the experimental design and for validity of the results by specifying the amount of weight that was added to the clamps and the student should also have specifyed the plastics that were used to make a more valid point. ^p A-10, 12. ^p B-22, 23. ^p C-14, 13. ^p D-20, 20.
2809	2	0	0	The second trail the first two numbers are higher then the two in the first trail. One number lower than the first time and the number the same, one way the could improve there experiment is they could of made a graph with there results.
2810	2	1	2	The question in this experiment is how many weights did it take take for the plastic to inicate while measuring. The conclusion was that T2 was more of a success. One way the student could have improved was explaing how heavy each weight was and how best you should add each weight to the clamp. Another way they could've improved was using the exact type of plastic with the same measurements.
2811	2	3	3	"(a) Plastic type ""B"" is made of the stretchiest material. (b) It does not say how many or how heavy the weights added are causing the results to be innacurate. Also, the length is not the same for any trials or type of plastic."
2812	2	1	1	Plastic type ''B'' contains the most elasticity. The could have explained was some of the different procedures were used for and to be more clear on explaining the procedure because when you explain a procedure you want to explain it in a way that any one can prefer in it.
2813	2	1	0	In conclusion, based on the students data collected, plastic type B was the farthest stretched. One way to improve the validity of their design to have different sizes of the plastic samples used. Another way to increase the validity is to get wide range of the different types of plastics.
2814	2	3	3	a) The plastic type B has the greatest stretchability out of the other 3 types. ^p b) The student should be clear about the length of each plastic to ensure that only independent variable is the type of plastic. Also, the student must determine the weight of the weights clamped on the plastic to keep one independent variable (plastic type). It is important to keep your constants, constant.
2815	2	2	2	Based on the student's data it looks like they wanted to see if their type of plastic had an effect on how far it can stretch. Plastic type D must be hard plastic because for both trials one and two the plastic did not move 1 mm. The students could have improved their results by telling us how much weight they used. Without the amount of weight no one knows how much to use so our results will be different. Also, in step 1 the students did not say how long the plastic must be cut.
2816	2	1	1	I conclude, based on the data, that out of the four different polymer plastics, plastic type B was able to stretch the most mm, 23mm. Other plastic type such as A only stretched 12mm; plastic type C only stretched 13mm and plastic type b only stretched 20mm.
2817	2	3	3	A: Based on the data I can conclude that plastic B had the most stretchability it stretched 22 and 23 mm. C 14 and 13mm and D 20,20 mm were in between. ^p B. One way the student could have improved their experiment design is to clerify everything. What plastic, how long are they etc. They could improve their validity by doing three trials instead of two.
2818	2	1	1	Plastic type A seems to have been stretchy because it was stretched 2mm while B and C only stretched 1mm. And type D is not stretchy because the number stayed at 20mm. The student could have used something heavy doing with tape to hold it on the table in ease it came off and they could have also used something better than a clamp to stretch it.
2819	2	2	2	A. My conclusion is that, based on the data, plastic B has the most stretchability. ^p B. The student could have improved the experiment by doing a third trial, and if needed, a fourth. The student could also have repeated the process to find out why T1 data is different from T2 data.
2820	2	3	3	Plastic type B is the most stretchable plastic out of the 4 reaching 22-23mm. to improve this expierment the person doing the lab needs to know the weight of the weights along with the clamp that is serving as another weight.
2821	2	3	3	In conclusion, the polymer with the most stretchability is Polymer B in T1 and T2 polymer B had the highest number of mm out of the other polymers. There for it stretched the greatest amount. In the future I think it would be helpful for the students to record how much weight they used to test each polymer. I also think it would be beneficia to test more trials to be confident in the results.
2822	2	2	2	a) Plastic type B is more stretchable than plastic type A,C,or D because in trial 1 plastic B stretched 22mm and it stretched 23mm. In both trials plastic type B stretched farther than the rest. a) The student could improve the experimental design by being specific with what 4 polymers she was using, the student could improve validity of her results by concluding even more trials than just 2.
2823	2	2	2	(A) I concluded that plastic type B is the plastic with the best stretchability. ^P (B) One way the students could have improved the experiment is by doing more than two trials for each type of plastic. Another way the experiment could be improved is by doing trials with different amount of weights.
2824	2	0	0	In conclusion some would strech alot and same wouldn't. They could improve it by adding more clamp or by streching it more.
2825	2	2	3	A-In both trials plastic type b stretched the most. It stretched  22mm in trial one and 23mm in trial-one. ^p One way the students could have improved their experiment is have all the plastics the same length. Another thing could they could have done to put on the weights till it repeat.
2826	2	0	0	Some of the students do like measuring but also like using the data table to find out the stretched amount is in the chart.
2827	2	2	2	"One of the many conclusions that can be drawn from this piece of data is that plastic ""D"" stretched the most and plastic ""A"" stretched the low. Two ways to improve this experiment is one, to add more trials, and two, describe the amount of weighs being added to the clamp. Thus piece of info is crucial."
2828	2	0	0	The two way the student could have improved the experimental design are why they put letters under plastic type is should be the type of plastic not A or B. My second way to improved the exeperimental design is the amount stretched (mm) is wrong because what is T1 and T2 where is the T3 if their three type of plastic.
2829	2	2	2	(A) Plastic type B is the stretchable plastic than type A, C, and D. ^P (B) Two ways the student could have improved the experiment is to make sure that each piece of tape is the same length because it may affect the stretchability of the plastic. Another way to improve the experiment is to add the same amount of weight to each plastic type because it may affect the amount stretched.
2830	2	1	1	Plastic type B is the polymer with the most stretchability. At the end of the experiment this is apparent because in both trials it stretched the most mm. Two ways to make the experiment better would be to leave the weights on for a longer period of time and also to add more weight on another was would be to make the experiment better would be to leave the heights on for a younger period of time and also to add more weight on. Another  way would be to use a double thickness of each material in evert trials.
2831	2	1	1	The conclusion that I draw based on the student's data is that plastic A streched the most. Two ways that the students could have improved their experimental design and/or validity of their results would be to test all the materials at least three times and to and to allow the weights to hang longer than five minutes. Testing all materials three times improves the student validity, because it becomes more accurate. Allowing wieghts to hang longer make it easier to see which material streches the most.
2832	2	1	0	a) After review of the results one can conclude that plastic type B as the most stretchable and durable this is because it had the highest mm stretch  distance for both trials.^p b) the student could have improved the results validity by performing 2 more trials after 2 minutes. By giving the plastics time to recover he can either test the durability over time.
2833	2	2	2	Based on the students data, plastic type B stretched the most with 22 and 23 where as plastic type A stretched 10 and 12. ^p One way they could improve is as by making the size of the plastic constant. Another way thing could improve it is by making sure that when your letting it hang to stop it at exactly 5 minutes as you can keep the time constant too.
2834	2	0	0	The students conclusion of this trial would be, plastic type 4 produced 10mm of streching for T1 and T2 produced 12mm so it increased by 2mm. Type B produced 12mm of strechability for T1 and 23mm for T2 for an increase of 1mm. type 3 produced 14mm of stretch ability for T1 and 13mm for T2 decreasing by 1mm. And lastly type D produced 20 mm of stretchability for T1 and 20 mm for T2. That's what a students conclusion would look like.
2835	2	1	1	2A)Based on the data, its possible that he's hypothesis was right, because the data seams close to each other, so there's a higher possibility rigth than wrong.  ^p 3) The could have made more trials including a control varable (one that doesn't change ) Another way as by adding more weights but do the procedure a little bat different.
2836	2	2	1	I have concluded that plastic B is the stretchiest and plastic A is the least stretchiest. A validity issue could have been leaving the weights on to long. Another validity issue could have been the measuring of the plastics was off.
2837	2	1	2	A) Plastic type B stretched the most after five minutes stretching 22mm in trial 1 and 23mm in trial 2. The plastic type that stretched the least was type A. It stretched 10mm in trial 1 and 12mm in trial 2. In conclusion the strongest polymer is type B. ^P B) The first way the student could improve on the experiment in a whole is tell what type of plastics were each. He also could tell how much weight was added during the trials.
2838	2	2	2	A. The plastic type B could stretch the longest at 22 and 23mm. Also the plastic type D is the only plastic that had the same length of 20mm for both trials. ^p B. Make a control having the clamp (without weight) be measured. Also they could've repeated the experiment by daily one more trial.
2839	2	1	1	a) Based on the students data, I can conclude that the amount each plastic type stretched at consistent rate during both trials. ^p b) The student could have improved the experimental design by specifying how much weight was being added to the plastic samples. They could've the validity of the experiment by trying different amounts of weight with each plastic sample.
2840	2	2	2	A. based on the results, I can conclude that plastic B stretched the farthest. In trials one and 2 it beat all others by at least a margin of two millimeters. B. One improvement they could've made is to any say length of each piece and make sure they were all equal. Another improvement could've been  to tell us the type of plastic for re-creature of the experiment.
2841	2	2	2	A conclusion based on the data is plastic type B is the longest stretching plastic used. Two ways they could have improved their experimental design / validity of their results by hanging the plastic sample in a different place, and by cutting all the plastic samples the same length because that was not stated in the procedure.
2842	2	1	1	I conclude that plastics A and C are a little stronger plastics than B and D because the both A and C stretched less than B and D. ^p Maybe 1 way to improve this is maybe wait a little longer until recording restarts because you might get a more interesting result. Another way to improve the validity of the answer to maybe test another time will get a third result making the answers more valid and presentable.
2843	2	0	0	a) A conclusion that could be drawn on their data is that on the plastic types C for T1 pool more than T2 and for plastic tyre D T1 and T2 had the same amount of stretched (mm). ^p b) They could have tested their experement out longer and they could have used more interesting materials.
2844	2	1	1	A) Plastic A & B stretched down the same. Plastic C was not that stretched down at all. B.) Two ways the students could have improved their experiment would be to measure the plastic type before stretched down. They should have had tested the plastic in different times. For example. T1 in 5 mins, T2 in 10 mins, trial 3 15mins, etc until 30 mins.
2845	2	1	1	Plastic types B, D are more stretchable than A, C. ^P They could do more trials and add more weights.
2846	2	2	2	a.) Based on the students data plastic type B stretched the farthest and therefor has the most stretchability. The one with the least stretchability was plastic type A. b.) One way the validity of the results could have done more trials. Another way the test could have been improved is by stretching the plastics by hand untill they break.
2847	2	1	1	If the students test out the four different plastic stretchability then add weights to the clamps on the bottom of the plastic and wait 5 minutes, they will come to the conclution that plastic that plastic B is the most stretchable plastic B's results the first time was 22 $ the second time 23. The second most stretchable is plastic D which was 20 then 20. So in closing the students found if they put weights on the 4 different type of plastic and wait 5 minutes then repeat that, plastic B is the most stretchable.
2848	2	2	2	(A) Based on the student's data, I can concluded that the plastic type A stretched the least with 10mm and 12mm. Plastic type B stretched the most with 22mm and 23mm. ^p (B) One way that the student could've improved the validity is to add more trials. Having at least 3 trials would have made this experiment more valid. Also, adding more time intervals instead of just one for five minutes would have improved this experiment.
2849	2	3	3	a. Based on the student's result, it can be concluded that plastic B is the most stretchable because it stretched an average of 22.5 mm in 5 minutes. Plastic A is the least stretchable because it stretched only 11 mm in 5 minutes on average. ^p b. 1. The student should have specified the amount of weight added to the clamp and possibly performed more trials at different weights. 2. The student should have performed a third trial to obtain more consistent and dependable results.
2850	2	0	0	On for in coud wont up on bown 14-13 on C the investigation be not be what A and B be. ^p A& D in not good two D bon't go up or bown so C and D is not good for the investigation.
2851	2	1	1	A) My conclusion from this expiriment is that plastic type A is flexible. B is somewhat flexible, C as well and type D isn't flexible at all. ^p B) The students could improve by being more detailed in things, like the weight of the clamp itself & including a control of each plastic.
2852	2	3	3	The conclustion of this lab according to the students, data type B of the plastic is the weakest and type A of the plastic is the strongest. For the plastic C and D, they are inbetween and C is close to A. The student could have improved the experiment by; saying the measurement of the plastic and how much mass the was on earth peice of plastic. Another way to improve the experiment is making sure the temperature is kept constant and that no one touches the plastic.
2853	2	3	3	The experiment was very precise and contained multiple trials that proved to be similar to the previous one. Plastic type B appears to have stretched the farthest but it is impossible to tell seeing there are no starting lengths. The plastics as well as the weights should have been the exact same size.
2854	2	2	3	A. Based on this students data, I can come to a conclusion that plastic type B was the most streched. ^p B. Two ways the student could have improved is by recording the length of the plastic before stretching. Also the student should have tested it three times instead of two.
2855	2	0	0	The table characteristic property we formulate in the table because 10 +12=22 and amount stretched (mm) T1 = total is 44 and T2=600 the total att ch 9 clamp to the bottom plastic sample.
2856	2	2	2	In this experiment I can conclude that plastic type B was the plastic that was  capable stretching the most. I can tell that plastic type A was the least able to stretch the most compared to other ones. Students can improve the design by having a control so that  they could compare aresults and makes experiment reliable. Also, in the procedure they should tell you how long the plastic should measure, how long the length should be.
2857	2	3	3	"a) Plastic type/polymer ""B"" had the best stretchability out of the other polymer plastics. The data shows that in ""B""s both trials it stretched 22 and 23 mm farthest than any other plastic. ^p b) Two ways to improve the design are by doing more trials to be more accurate and by stating the amount of weight put on each bag (the same amount of weight)."
2858	2	2	2	According to the data table plastic type B is the plastic that stretched the most without ripping. One way that the student could improve is in the procedure when it says add weights she should tell how heavy should the weights be. Also, she should tell what plastics were used.
2859	2	3	3	a. Based on the data on the table, I can conclude that plastic B was the stretchiest followed by plastic D, C, then A. His results also seem precise because he did two trials and they were totally close to each other every time.  ^p b.  In the procedure, the student should have made each plastic sample the same size keeping it a constant variable. They also should explained how much weight to put on the clamps as it was omitted in the procedure.
2860	2	2	2	a) Based on the data plastic type ''B'' is able to stretch out the best compared to all other the differant plastic types. ^p b) One way the students could have improved the experiment would be increasing the amount of trials. ^p Another way to improve the experiment would be to increase the amount of minutes it's left hanging. For example from 5 minutes to 10 minutes.
2861	2	2	2	The conclusion can be made that the plastic type B has the greatest stretchability because in both trials, is stretched the greatest number of mm in comparison to the other 3 plastic types. the student should have conducted at least 1 more trial to validate the experiment since 3 trials are necessary. For a valid experiment would impact the stretchability more tests and constants would make the results more reliable.
2862	2	2	2	a) You can see the trails were accurate to eachother plastic B stretched the least (with the average 11mm).^p b) the student could have improved the expierement by including the ongional measure of the plastic. They could have made the results more valid by keeping the weights on longer so there would be more variation between each result.
2863	2	2	2	This investigation shows that plastic B stretched the most but or are the plastics used in this experiment. ^P One way the investigation could be to add more trials, second, if they added more time then maybe the outcome would have changed.
2864	2	1	1	I can conclude that in trial 2 had a small impact on trial 1. The students could of improved adding the at same amount of weight to both type of plastics and keep that weights longer.
2865	2	1	1	a. Plastic B, C are almost similar but plastic D stretched the most. ^p b. Two ways they can improve experiment was by adding a 3rd trial and also adding different times.
2866	2	2	2	They could of improved it by putting their weight on them the same time and put the same amount of weight and had tried the object more than 2 times.
2867	2	1	1	Plastic Type C stretched the most in both of its trials and plastic Type A stretched the least in both of the trials. The students could have allowed the plastics to long longer than 5 minutes, incase it takes some plastics longer to stretch. The students also could have used plastics that all had the same length to begin with, to eliminate all chances of error.
2868	2	2	2	Plastic type A and B increased on the second trial while plastic type C decreased by 1mm and plastic type D stayed the same mm both trials. ^p The students could have improved the design by conducting another trial to get accurate results. The students could have been specific on the weight of the weights. For example, add 1 pound weights to the clamp and allow them to hang for five minutes.
2869	2	0	0	The student could do better by describing it more how she did it and what she did, Add, subtracting, multiply, divide or something.
2870	2	1	1	a Based off the information given plastic type B stretched the most, the type D, type C, type A. ^p B. Place more weight & let it hang longer or less.
2871	2	1	2	Plastic D didn't change and plastic A stretched more in trial 2. Basically most of the plastics change but not all of them. ^p One way is making each plastic the same length before the experiment. A second way is use the same amount of tape for each plastic type.
2872	2	1	0	According to the student's data, the plastic that streched the most was plastic type D and the one that streched the least was plastic type A. ^p I think that this experiment could have been improved by instead of having a second trial, you should have added more time.
2873	2	2	2	From the data given to me, I can draw the conclusion that plastic type A is the least stretchable of the plastics probably because of it's tight bonding. Plastic D on the other hand is the most strechable of the polymers (loose bonding). One way the student could have improved his results could have been a 3rd trial that would improve the validity. A second way to improve the validity of this experiment would be to ensure one self to have the same length plastic and time the experiment.
2874	2	3	3	a) Plastic type B is the stretchiest plastic. In T1 it  Stretched 22 mm, and in T2 it stretched 23mm. The least stretched plastic was type A. In T1, A stretched 10mm and in T2 it stretched 12mm. Type D was second stretchiest and type C was behind D. ^p b) Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design/validity of the experiment is having a specific size of the original piece of plastic to stretch, and having a specific weight of the weight stretching the plastic. Constant keep the results of experiment valid.
2875	2	1	1	One conclusion I made is that everytime in trial 2 it goes farther than in trial 1 the numbers increase. Two ways the student have improved on their experiment is by is by being more specific in their procedure and by adding a trial 3.
2876	2	1	1	2.)At the end of the experiment i have concluded that plastic B had the best stretchability because in 1 and 2 it reached 22 mm the first time and 23 mm the second time. My hypothesis was also wrong because I had predicted plastic A would have the most stretchability but it didn't.^p (b)1.Put something heavier then weights. (2)Attach something other then a clamp.
2877	2	1	1	A) My conclusion based on the student's data is that T2 A-B held a stronger than for T1; C for T1 was the one more mm than T2 but both trials seemed out for plastic type D. ^p B) Two ways those students could have improved is if they kept the plastic the same size and shape. And if they let hang for a min longer.
2878	2	2	2	a. Out of all the plastic, plastic A is the stretchiest. Based on the data, it stretches 2 mm while the others stretched 1 mm or 0 mm. ^p b. To improve the experiment, the student could have used plastics that were all the same length to begin with. The student also, should've verified the weight of the weights they used and made alls they used the same weight throughout.
2879	2	2	2	A) In conclusion, plastic B had the most stretchability. ^p B) One way the student could have improved this experiment could be to start with the same length of plastic for each trial & each plastic. The second way I would change the experiment would be to use a stop watch & be very presice about the time.
2880	2	1	1	A.) The conclusion I have drawn about the students data table is that plastics A and B where stretchable. While C actually decrease in size and D did not stretch at all. ^P B.) Two ways that the student could improve this experiment is by naming the different plastics so you know your not looking the same kind of plastic that then once. Also to add more trials because they only held two.
2881	2	3	3	Plastic type B was the most strechably polymer. The student could have conducted more trails and tell us how much the weights weigh.
2882	2	2	2	Based on the student's data, you can conclude that plastic A streched the most. One way the student could have improved the experiment could be to have all of the plastics be the same size at the start of the experiment. Another way they could improve the experiment is to add a specific amount of weights in the clamp and have it be the same weight for each plastic.
2883	2	2	2	a) Plastic type B is the stretchiest based on their data. ^p b) It could have be improved by using plastics of the same length. He also could have taken different lengths of the same plastic.
2884	2	2	2	Plastic type A was the stretchiest. The student could have improved the validity of the results by doing more trials in the investigation, and by measuring the plastic prior to the experiment.
2885	2	3	3	a) Plastic B has the most stretchability. If you take the average of the two trials plastic B, 22.5 mm, is higher then plastic A, 11mm, plastic C, 13.5mm, and plastic D, 10mm. ^p b) One way the students could have improved the experiment is by giving a specific amount of weight to add to each clamp. Another improvement would be to do third trial because this could increase the validity.
2886	2	1	1	a. My conclusion would be that the plastic type B would be better because it stretched more. ^p b. One way the could have improved there experiment design would have been leaving on e of the plastic bags, with the weights the whole time ( control) types of plastic bags.
2887	2	1	1	Two ways tat the student could have improved was to let the weights hang there for a little more time. Also use the same length of plastic for each trial.

10992	5	3	3	When the mRNA leaves the nucleus, it fits through the holes by virtue of being single-stranded. The mRNA floats around until it encounters a ribosome. The ribosome latches on to the mRNA with the larger portion nesting with and reading three nitrogenous bases, called a codon, at a time. The ribosome says in semi-stasis until a tRNA with the proper corresponding nitrogenous bases bumps into it. The tRNA is held by the ribosome until the second codon has been read, and a second tRNA is bonded to by the Ribosome. A peptide (dehydration synthesis) bond forms between the two amino acids, and the initial tRNA is 'cut loose' The ribosome then moves on down the mRNA creating the protein coded for. A strand of mRNA can be translated several times.

The codons of the messenger RNA are matched up with their codons for a transfer RNA. The transfer RNA is made and can then continue to do its job while more transfer RNAs are being copied. Then the Rnas can go to the ribosomes and give them the message to make more proteins.

23824	9	2	1	At first the author gives a great explanation on what he or she is going to talk about. He or she starts to explain that space junk is bad for the globe. Then the author starts to explain what the space junk is. It is the human race's great space invasion of the Soviet Union and the United States satellites that have been launched in space. The next set of information explains the crash course of the satellites. If the satellites come near eash other then they will crash into each other and then our country would not be able to have that control anymore. The next information the author talks about is the tiny bits of space trash, or also called space junk, that is in space floating around.
