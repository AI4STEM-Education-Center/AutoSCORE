You are a precise Rubric Decomposer. Return JSON only. No prose outside JSON.

[USER]
Read the rubric below and produce a machine-usable SPEC describing:
- which components to extract from a student's response,
- how to normalize/deduplicate them,
- and the exact JSON output schema.

Keep the design general but tailored to THIS rubric.

# RUBRIC
{rubric_text}

# REQUIRED OUTPUT (JSON ONLY)
Return a single JSON object with the fields:
{
  "components": [
    {
      "name": "<snake_case_field_name>",
      "description": "<what to extract in 1–2 sentences>",
      "type": "bool | int | string | list[string]"
    }
    // 1–5 items
  ],
  "normalization_rules": [
    "<short, actionable rules for deduping, splitting, ignoring vagueness, bucketing, etc.>"
    // 3–10 items
  ],
  "output_schema": {
    // keys = component names and any derived counters (e.g., info_count)
    // values = the same atomic types above
    "<field_name>": "<type>"
  },
  "rubric_specific_guidance": [
    "<short bullets clarifying ambiguous cases and typical examples/synonyms>",
    "<do not restate the whole rubric>"
  ]
}

Constraints:
- Use short, unambiguous English phrases.
- If the rubric implies counting distinct items, include an explicit *count* field in output_schema.
- Do NOT include any freeform text outside JSON.
