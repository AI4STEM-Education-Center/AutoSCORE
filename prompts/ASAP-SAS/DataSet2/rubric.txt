## Sample Response:
**Conclusions:**
- Plastic sample B has more stretchability than the other polymer plastics.
- Plastic sample A has the least amount of stretchability compared to the other polymer plastics.
- Not all polymer plastics have the same stretchability.
- Different polymer plastics have different stretchability (and are therefore suited for different applications).
- A reasonable conclusion cannot be drawn due to procedural errors.
- Other reasonable conclusions

**Experimental Design Improvements:**
- Provide the before and after measurements for length (Did the samples all start out the same size?).
- Make sure the samples are all of the same thickness. Variations in thickness could have caused variations in stretchability.
- Perform additional trials. Some of the samples have similar stretchability (A and C, B and D). Two trials may not be enough to conclusively state that one is more stretchable than the other.
- Indicate how many weights were added to the clamps (Was it the same number for each sample?).
- Other acceptable responses

## 3-Point Rubric:
**Score 3**
The response draws a valid conclusion supported by the student’s data and describes two ways the student could have improved the experimental design and/or the validity of the results.

**Score 2**
The response draws a valid conclusion supported by the student’s data and describes one way the student could have improved the experimental design and/or the validity of the results.
OR
The response describes two ways the student could have improved the experimental design and/or the validity of the results but fails to draw or incorrectly draws a conclusion from the student’s data.

**Score 1**
The response draws a valid conclusion supported by the student’s data but fails to describe, or incorrectly describes, how the student could have improved the experimental design and/or the validity of the results.
OR
The response describes one way the student could have improved the experimental design and/or the validity of the results but fails to draw or incorrectly draws a conclusion from the student’s data.

**Score 0**
The response provides little or no correct information from the polymer investigation.
